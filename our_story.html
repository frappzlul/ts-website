In total, three teamtages were made, and we grew the channel from 12 Subscribers to 150. Our VALORANT division was disbanded in September, however the Fortnite Division was put on hiatus after six of our primary Fortnite Players were released. The video shown below is the second Teamtage of the initial Team Scarlet Fortnite division. </p><figure style="padding-bottom:33.723653395784545%" class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="./our_story_files/OgMhE0O-uTM.html"></iframe></div></figure><p>‍</p></div><div class="div-block">The New Team Scarlet - Our Projection<br>‍<br></div><div>We plan to relaunch Team Scarlet after our second hiatus on December 18th 2021, with four new divisions, and a new goal for our impact in eSports and gaming. We plan to create a space where gamers can learn, play and overall have a good experience. We plan to allow any and all into Team Scarlet, under our (soon to form) Project SYNTAX. We also intend to create a beacon for the gamers of the Caribbean, for it is often thought that the Caribbean does not have an impact on the esports industry nor the gaming industry. Join us, on our road to a new beacon for esports, and for the hope and inspiration of gamers across the region.<br><br>December 18th, 2021. See you there.</div></div></main><script src="./our_story_files/jquery-3.5.1.min.dc5e7f18c8.js.download" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="./our_story_files/webflow.166720a07.js.download" type="text/javascript"></script><!--[if lte IE 9]><script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/placeholders/3.0.2/placeholders.min.js"></script><![endif]-->
